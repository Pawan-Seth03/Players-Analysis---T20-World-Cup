# Players-Analysis---T20-World-Cup
In this project, we extract and analyze player data from the official T20 World Cup cricket website using Python web scraping techniques. The dataset includes details such as:
- Player names
- Runs scored
- Boundaries hit
- Balls faced
- Overs bowled
- Bowling performance statistics
- Wickets taken
- Batting style
- Innings
- Total runs accumulated by each player across the tournament
The ultimate objective is to identify and build the Best Playing XI team based on the overall performance of players throughout the World Cup.


# Objective
To create the Best Playing XI team by applying performance-based selection criteria, ensuring the final team closely matches the official ICC Best XIâ€”indicating that a logical and effective approach has been used.

- High strike rate
- Large number of balls faced
- Minimum 25 runs scored

Middle Order:
- Good strike rate
- Batting position greater than 2
- Average balls faced > 10

Final Team -
The final team will be a balanced mix of top performers from all categories (openers, middle-order players, lower-order hitters, all-rounders, and bowlers). This ensures both batting and bowling strengths are covered, resulting in a strong and competitive Playing XI.

Note - Our best playing 11 is mostly match with the icc best 11. This means that a good approch for player selection has been used
